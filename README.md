stablogen is [yet another](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yet_another) static
blog generator. It uses [Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) and
[Pygments](http://pygments.org/). If you actually want to use a static blog
generator, I highly suggest you use one of the many others that
are eaiser to use, more powerful and/or have objectively better design (e.g.
As of writting [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) or
[Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/) look good for just about anyone),
however I wrote this one and use it for
[my personal blog](https://fred.hornsey.us). As such it contains the content
and settings for my blog.
