stablogen is [yet another](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yet_another) static
blog generator. If want to use a static blog generator there are others that
are eaiser to use, more powerful and/or have objectively better code (e.g. As
of writting [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) or
[Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/) look good to me), however I wrote this
one and use it for [my personal blog](https://fred.hornsey.us). As such it
contains the content and settings for my blog.
