# stablogen

**stablogen** is [yet another](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yet_another) static
blog generator. It uses [Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) and
[Pygments](http://pygments.org/). If you want to make a real blog with a 
static blog generator, I **strongly** suggest you use one of the many others
that are eaiser to use, more powerful and/or have objectively better design
(e.g. As of writting [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) or
[Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/) look good for just about anyone),
however I wrote this one ~~and use it for
[my personal blog](https://fred.hornsey.us)~~ (Not yet, but soon). As such it
contains the content and settings for my blog.


## Dependencies
To install the required dependencies, please run:
`pip install Jinja2 arrow PyYAML Pygments`
