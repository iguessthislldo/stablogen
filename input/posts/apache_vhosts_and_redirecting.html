<p>When using Apache' s <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/vhosts/">virtual hosts</a> for the first time it can be easy (at least for me) to make mistake(s) trying to get it a very specific way. For me that specific way was as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a main host that lives on a subdomain (this site BTW) that only accepts https.</li>
<li>By default, anything else redirects to the main site...</li>
<li>Except for other virtual hosts</li>
</ul>
<p>This might seem simple if you a little bit about virtual hosts, which I thought I did before setting this site up. However, the problem I had today was that I kept either getting forbidden responses or redirected to another other virtual host (Not the one I wanted). Below is the gist of my working {%icode %}000-default.conf{%endicode%} as of writing:</p>

{% code "apache", "000-default.conf" -%}
# Replace "domain.tld" with your root domain, "subdomain" with the subdomain
# you want to use as you main site, and subdomain@domain.tld with email you want the server to use.

# Redirect http://(*.)domain.tld:80 and https://(*.)domain.tld:433 to https://subdomain.domain.tld
# Except for other other virtual hosts

# HTTP
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin subdomain@domain.tld

    # Logging
    # Rename these if you have or own scheme or remove them to log to the default files
    LogLevel warn
    ErrorLog    ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/default_redirect_error.log
    CustomLog   ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/default_redirect_access.log combined

    # Redirect to https://subdomain.domain.tld/
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteRule "^/?(.*)"      "https://subdomain.domain.tld/$1" [L,R,NE]
</VirtualHost>

# HTTPS
<IfModule mod_ssl.c>
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerAdmin subdomain@domain.tld

    # Logging
    # Rename these if you have or own scheme or remove them to log to the default files
    LogLevel warn
    ErrorLog    ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/default_redirect_error.log
    CustomLog   ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/default_redirect_access.log combined

    # SSL Stuff Goes here
    # I'm not completely sure this entire virtual host is necessary, but I decided to leave it

    # Redirect to https://subdomain.domain.tld/
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteRule "^/?(.*)"      "https://subdomain.domain.tld/$1" [L,R,NE]
</VirtualHost>
</IfModule>
{%- endcode %}

<p>I was having problems at first because I wasn't even using  {%icode%}000-default.conf{%endicode%} as a name, just the domain name. If apache is configured to use {%icode%}sites-available{%endicode%}  and {%icode%}sites-enabled{%endicode%} it loads them alphabetically (I guess?). Any way the first virtual host on the first config file loaded is the "default" one.</p>

<p>I was still having problems though, and even though I left directives like {%icode "apache"%}<DocumentRoot "/var/www/...">{%endicode%} and {%icode "apache"%}<ServerAlias domain.tld>{%endicode%} in there what finally fixed redirecting from the root domain to the subdomain was changing {%icode "apache"%}<VirtualHost *:*>{%endicode%} to {%icode "apache"%}<VirtualHost *:80>{%endicode%}. This was thorwing me off because the line is
<a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/vhosts/examples.html#proxy">on the Apache website</a> but does't produce the result I thought it would: catching everything that was not port 443 or the other virtual hosts. This is made clear if you run {%icode "sh"%}apachectl -S{%endicode%}, which prints the current configuration, and is great for debugging the virtual hosts because it lists them in order of precedence.</p>
