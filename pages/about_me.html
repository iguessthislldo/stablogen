<h2>About</h2>
<p>My name is <b>Frederick Hornsey</b> and I'm currently a CS Undergrad.</p>
<h3>Blog</h3>
<p>Right now I'm hoping to post about the following in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any software or framework i'm playing with (Ex: <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> or
<a href=https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki>MediaWiki</a>)</li>
<li>I thinking about focusing on Time/Calendar related programing for future work, so I might post about that I go about</li>
<li>game development, specifically with <a href="http://www.sfml-dev.org/">SFML</a></li>
<li>web development</li>
<li>Linux: specifically Arch, Ubuntu, and Debian</li>
<li>I want to play with FreeBSD or OpenBSD at some point.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> (3 of course), which is the language I feel most comfortable with.</li>
<li>C++, which I'm not sure I'll ever get used to but I still try</li>
<li>Currently learning <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a></li>
<li>After Rust I would like to learn a functional language, almost certainly would be <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>.</li>
<li>Maybe somestuff from school if I feel especially proud of it or it's interesting</li>
</ul>

<p>This blog was built by from scratch (if you don't count <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>) by me.
The only other things here that I didn't make are <a href="https://disqus.com/">DISQUS</a> (the comments)  and
the following fonts:
Monofur by Tobias Benjamin KÃ¶hler (Offical page no longer available),
<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto">Roboto</a>,
and <a href="http://fontawesome.io/"><span style="white-space: nowrap;">
    <i class="fa fa-fa" aria-hidden="true">&nbsp;</i>Font Awesome</a>.</span>
</p>
<p>The reason I made it from scratch is to get familiar with Django again,
although I'm not against migrating to a service like tumblr or ghost if this
becomes a hassle in the future. Also It was (mostly) fun. The only things I
would like to change about it if I have the time is some visual improvements
and making it easier to post things, other wise I'm happy with it.</p>
